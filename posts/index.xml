      <description>I have a happy orchid plant
One that blooms white with a purple hue
Standing against my window nonchalant
Shining against the sun effortless
And then one day I decided to move
My happy orchid sat in a box
Waiting to see the light
But for a while it was left forgotten
In the darkness, while I sorted my affairs
It stood biding its wait
As dust settled on its glossy green leaves</description>
