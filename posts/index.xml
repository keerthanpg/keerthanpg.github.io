      <description>So I chanced by this post on LessWrong titled &amp;ldquo;Reward is Not Enough&amp;rdquo;. It is a rebuttal to the arguments presented in the paper &amp;ldquo;Reward is Enough&amp;rdquo; by Silver et al, which hypothesises that intelligence and its associated attributes are a result of reward maximization of an agent acting in its environment. Given the popularity of the LessWrong Forum, the pseudo-persuasive appeal of the article aided by technical jargon and for the sake of rationality, the post merits a deeper examination.</description>

      <description>I have a happy orchid plant
One that blooms white with a purple hue
Standing against my window nonchalant
Shining against the sun effortless
And then one day I decided to move
My happy orchid sat in a box
Waiting to see the light
But for a while it was left forgotten
In the darkness, while I sorted my affairs
It stood biding its wait
As dust settled on its glossy green leaves</description>
