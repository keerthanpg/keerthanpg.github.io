      <title>My Happy Orchid</title>

      <description>I have a happy orchid plant
One that blooms white with a purple hue
Standing against my window nonchalant
Shining against the sun effortless
And then one day I decided to move
My happy orchid sat in a box
Waiting to see the light
But for a while it was left forgotten
In the darkness, while I sorted my affairs
It stood biding its wait
As dust settled on its glossy green leaves</description>

Silence
Like an ocean that leaps and bounds
Like a dragon that kicks and breathes fire, alive
Like a wide chasm between us
Our hearts are so far, far apart
Closed to each other
Though for a second we were so close
Like a bridge out into happiness
Like a hand that appears while drowning
But now I’m puzzled
Standing on a vast mountain range
Looking into caves very strange</description>

Tied up angel, wings battered
Shackled by the ankles
I lay rotting in the dirt
Among worms and spiders
Helpless and desolate
Like a forgotten ghost in the ceiling
But then I mustered my will,
Chewed up the chains
And through the broken attic window
I climbed
Cut my wings on the glass
Yet jumped into the moonlight
And took flight into an unknown
With broken chains on my ankles</description>

Pacing through a glass castle of mine
That is shattered in all but a second
At once when one is hit in the face by the chilling storm outside
How can you be mine but yet never have been mine
Feeling threatened in the most primal way
I’m alone, irrevocably so, irreversibly so
Even when engulfed in your arms
Listening to your heart beats so close</description>

I have
I have a faceless portrait
One I’ve been holding close
For far too long
Etched over years, touched over every now and then
With each new dawn
The lines grow clearer
A faceless portrait hanging on a pedestal
Across my hallway
Waiting to come alive.
Beaming with pride and
Embellishing the sides
I only need a face to completion.
So I set out to find one</description>

From Google Images
I walked down the road
Through alleys and corridors
In search of you
TRying to catch your eyes in the crowd
Sliding past glass windows for a sign
Of you
Your voice still rings in my ears,
As if playing with them constantly
Much like your lively, restless spirit
Your thoughts are fresh in my mind
They emerge from me
Become a hundred fireflies</description>

If the moment is beautiful, is consistency necessary
If the eyes align, why do the stars need to
If happiness can precipitate in the now, who cares if the past and future are unmade
If the timeline is a mist, so what, if today is stark clear in a happy, mad hue
Can we count our sins after today, losing,
Can we contradict our values, shackles of morals, just for once</description>

Do I ever cross your mind?
If only as a brief flutter
Do I ever make you wind?
Your words, if only a stutter
Do you ever think about me?
Just one thought, if only, in your day
I wish it was my hands that you reached out for
I wish it was my lips that felt your kiss
I wish it was me that you woke up to</description>

A storm still raged in the midst of sea,
Where I had murdered you,
I lost you, far away
Your bloodstains mixed in the steam
Like a whirlpool of red
But far out in the sea where no one could see
Your face haunts me
My hands feeling, forever slippery with your blood
If I’ve slain, why are you still tied to me
Like an albatross around my neck</description>

No,
I will not be the decked up doll,
Meant to please
Dumbed down by the appropriate amount
Draped in a tone of sugar and niceness
Intellect and insanity stuffed down to a small chest
Thrown into a sea
Sinking deep in its bellies
While the silent waves leave no hint
Of the tempest that rages within
I refuse to be the calm waves that kiss your feet</description>

A dream hung on like raindrops on power cables overhead
A whole gleamy world in itself, a fairytale world
Full of promises and enforced perfection, off a story book
Walking on the tightrope of time,
I emerged from the drop unscathed in the heart
Or did the drop disappear altogether?
I do not know. I do not remember.
May be I was a fool that summoned the untrue</description>

Photograph by Kevin Frayer 1
The photographer Kevin Frayer explains the scene: “I arrived to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, in mid-September, a few weeks into the #Rohingya crisis. I was looking for places to photograph food aid because there was such a need for it and so little of it around. I was in an area where there was a crowd of people surrounding a truck. The scene was quite chaotic; people were shouting and reaching because they were obviously distraught and hungry.</description>

Hopping over puddles, in a little pink frock
Hardly as tall as your knee cap,
Grasping tightly your index, with an entire little pink palm
Running to catch up with you,
Even as you lift and place me
Across small pools of water on the road
Over time your pace slowed and mine picked up
That you slowly heave to match my pace
Making me wonder when I outstripped you.</description>

Normal waves
Dampened by the sinking weights
of hurt over years
Unflinching today
Unmoved
Blanks eyes, and quizzical brows
Witness doubtful cries
Numb is the word
To what I feel
A game of rock, paper, scissors
Defeated are those who show their guts
Feeling small
Laying it out there
Bare, to be trampled on
To be a display
On the sidewalks of an uncaring passerby
Screams fall on deaf ears</description>

The contours of your face
Imprinted in my memories
Your face, that I’ve worshiped
Years went by
The wheel of time and with it the pages of history piled
But why,
Why don’t they erase your face from my heart
Why don’t they dirty it
Tear your pristine portraits
Why do you prevail
Like the bizarre sorrow of a cold night
Like the forgotten whisper in the whirling wind</description>

Shedding leaves and pretenses
Dropping off, pieces of one’s soul
Carried in the wind,
Passing on the living will
Leaving bare bones, branches behind
Shrinking in, staring within
Introverted shrugging to oneself
Quiet, unhindered
Preparing to be hit
By the the chill of loneliness
A lazy winter and creeping cold
Like cancer on your determination
Spreading eerily, binding you
Estranged frosty bite of a distilled purpose</description>

A bag of thoughts we are
a tiny little star
sweltering pot
a burning core at its heart
likes and dislikes
ambitions and idiosyncracies
philosophies, glued together
in a weak concoction of will
A sphere of influence around
we hold close ones
As we journey through space,
carrying our identities
our baggage
in a journey called life
People come by, simering plasma like us,
held together by their will</description>

Third somebody in the room
Like an impenetrable wall
Between us.
The mind knits careful words
yearns for a soft feel of the cheeks
pinches in anticipation of the kiss.
Unsaid, undone.
Cheesy sugary eternals
Aborted, replaced with blank expressions
All the love means nothing
With a strange face in the room
Not intimate, never alone..
Not two, always three.
Cackling laughter that fills the room</description>
