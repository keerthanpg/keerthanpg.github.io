<p>Pacing through a glass castle of mine</p>
<p>That is shattered in all but a second</p>
<p>At once when one is hit in the face by the chilling storm outside</p>
<p>How can you be mine but yet never have been mine</p>
<p>Feeling threatened in the most primal way</p>
<p>I’m alone, irrevocably so, irreversibly so</p>
<p>Even when engulfed in your arms</p>
<p>Listening to your heart beats so close</p>
<p>I hear your words but they fall empty</p>
<p>For I no longer feel them</p>
<p>Having been fooled, oh so thoroughly</p>
<p>And alone I pace, alone I walk and pick up the shatters</p>
<p>Of what our relationship was supposed to be</p>
<p>No longer worthwhile, an illusion that was as real to be almost palpable, yet so truly unreal in its core</p>
<p>Like a dream that could’ve been but just wasn’t</p>
<p>Why’d you drop the nest we were building?</p>
<p>For the briefness of pleasure you destroyed what could’ve been, perhaps, a lifetime</p>
<p>And now there’s no way to go back</p>
<p>Hard as I try and you try</p>
<p>There’s no way to go back</p>
<p>Even if I ardently wish there was</p>
<p>For there is no where where I can be</p>
<p>With my head held high and clasp your arms at the same time</p>
<p>And often there’s no will for the heart is tired</p>
<p>Of being let down, taking apart a cobweb of lies</p>
<p>Discovering you in a different light</p>
<p>Every day</p>
<p>Sinking in the slow realization that who I loved never existed</p>
<p>Your image in my mind, once elegant,</p>
<p>Crumbling to a tiny ball of paper to be cast away in trash</p>
<p>That all I saw was a shadow I desired to see</p>
<p>In the shells of a frail, small, old skeleton that is unremarkably you</p>
<p>You never had been the man I wanted or adored or respected</p>
<p>You never had been the man I thought I held close</p>
<p>You never had been and we never had been.</p>
<p>One can only be hurt so much and then numbness takes over</p>
<p>Whoever said that the opposite of love was hate?</p>
<p>For the opposite of love is indifference,</p>
<p>Stone, cold, unyielding indifference</p>
<p>That is taking over my heart, freezing it into stone,</p>
<p>Unfeeling and cold and indifferent</p>
<p>And closed to you</p>
<p>Decidedly beyond your reach.</p>
