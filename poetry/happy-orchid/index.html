    <p>I have a happy orchid plant<br>
One that blooms white with a purple hue<br>
Standing against my window nonchalant<br>
Shining against the sun effortless</p>
<p>And then one day I decided to move<br>
My happy orchid sat in a box<br>
Waiting to see the light<br>
But for a while it was left forgotten</p>
<p>In the darkness, while I sorted my affairs<br>
It stood biding its wait<br>
As dust settled on its glossy green leaves<br>
Turning them a shackled shade of brown</p>
<p>Then one day I took my happy plant out to the sun<br>
But lo, along fell its wilted flowers<br>
Dried as though from a deep sorrow<br>
Crumpled as if from age and fatigue</p>
<p>I still kept the plant on my countertop<br>
Lamenting its languished flowers<br>
Barren in a dusty charm<br>
It stood biding its wait again</p>
<p>I never stopped watering<br>
Seeking hope like an oasis in a desert<br>
I gently wiped the dusty leaves and<br>
Picked away the last drooping flower</p>
<p>Leaving behind what’s dead and long gone<br>
Decidedly I accepted the present<br>
Thus many days went by<br>
And the sun smiled and set upon us aplenty</p>
<p>But one day, just as I had forgotten<br>
A little bud sprung up on the stalk<br>
Like all but one acne<br>
On a pretty woman’s flawless face</p>
<p>And then another and another<br>
Soon, my happy orchid was just as alive again, even more,<br>
All the watering triumphed over hopelessness<br>
And happiness was knocking at my door again</p>
<p>As though happiness was waiting for me<br>
To walk from an unserving present<br>
Just one hard decision away<br>
And I only need say yes</p>
<p>New doors open where others close<br>
Like little buds overwhelming an orchid stem<br>
That drooping flowers once clung from<br>
My happiness, that I so fiercely fought for<br>
That I’m determined to protect at every cost<br>
Compounds to abundance from undiscovered prospects<br>
Like relentlessly blooming beautiful flowers<br>
On my beaming orchid plant in the sun.</p>
