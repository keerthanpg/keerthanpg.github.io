<p>Hopping over puddles, in a little pink frock<br>
Hardly as tall as your knee cap,<br>
Grasping tightly your index, with an entire little pink palm<br>
Running to catch up with you,<br>
Even as you lift and place me<br>
Across small pools of water on the road</p>
<p>Over time your pace slowed and mine picked up<br>
That you slowly heave to match my pace<br>
Making me wonder when I outstripped you..<br>
Have you grown old, or have you always been that slow?</p>
<p>Your shoulders were the highest places on earth<br>
Whether to watch fireworks at the temple fair<br>
Or looked egotistically down at siblings on my mother’s shoulders<br>
From my high up perch, higher than everyone<br>
Although, you don’t seem so towering today..<br>
May be because I grew up!</p>
<p>I could never cease to be captivated<br>
At your many animatic retellings of the fox and the sour grapes<br>
As you enacted the fox, smacking hungrily at the grapes<br>
And I watched still with suspense<br>
Wearing nothing but a little chaddi on Sunday mornings<br>
and letting slip bursts of giggles and wild applause at the end<br>
Prevailing over the twitch of steamy dosa batter<br>
As Amma spread them on hot pans in the kitchen</p>
<p>Your sneeze could shake me with shock<br>
Jolting my heart inside my very chest<br>
Your palms and feet were large as a scary predator<br>
But of late, wrinkles have lined up your forehead<br>
Your smile has grown tired, your face scaled<br>
Your slouch paining and arms have grown saggy<br>
Each time I visit, do you grow a little older?</p>
<p>Your hair line has retreated, and your belly grown pronounced<br>
A few more gray hairs have propped up on your scalp<br>
Couple more lines on your face<br>
Looking back, you are not the man of my childhood<br>
With a stiff bare back and haughty pace<br>
Running up and down the stairs youthfully<br>
and throwing imaginary cricket balls in the air, pacing<br>
Your temper softened, your voice mellowed<br>
Reading your newspapers with spectacles now<br>
Slouched like a caged, retired lion<br>
And a youth gone by..<br>
Looking back, you are not the man of my childhood<br>
Even though your eyes are menacingly curious as ever<br>
You’ve grown old..<br>
and I’ve taken your place!</p>
<p>Inherited your love for pepper and books,<br>
Your haughty pride in our ancestory<br>
And stories of the British honouring your great-grandfather<br>
And estranged relatives that set sail to Ceylon!<br>
I have taken on, your love for Carnatic and Nehru<br>
Tales of landlords and cesses<br>
And playing by the Bharathapuzha<br>
Broken sculptures piled in an old Kalari<br>
Where no one lights a lamp now<br>
Up for sale are old roots</p>
<p>Barren, broken and changed,<br>
From Ottapalam to California,<br>
What a long way we have come<br>
Seeds of our DNA, and creative destruction of the old<br>
Soon my skin will wither away<br>
My muscles will atrophy..<br>
To give way to the future, somewhere we’ll have a mark<br>
A tiny remembrance<br>
A testimony to a full, colorful life lived.</p>
