<p>The photographer Kevin Frayer explains the scene: “I arrived to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, in mid-September, a few weeks into the #Rohingya crisis. I was looking for places to photograph food aid because there was such a need for it and so little of it around. I was in an area where there was a crowd of people surrounding a truck. The scene was quite chaotic; people were shouting and reaching because they were obviously distraught and hungry. There was a lot of pushing in the crowd and I wanted to get above it, so I climbed on the truck. That’s when I saw this small boy. He had just pulled himself up onto the truck and he was weeping. I couldn’t hear much because the scene was so loud, but at one point the boy reached out his hands, begging to the man standing over the food. Then, he wrapped his arms around the man’s legs, clinging to him. I was totally struck by it: he had clawed his way onto the truck in complete desperation. I wish I knew more about him, but he disappeared into the chaos of the moment.”</p>
<p>Us and them<br>
Is what Nationalism has now fallen to<br>
Their barbarism vs our culture<br>
Their savagery vs our civilisation<br>
Their invasion vs our tolerance<br>
Their Abrahamic gods vs our transcendental greatness<br>
Children are taught to hate<br>
Rohingyas, Pakistanis, Muslims, even Dalits<br>
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam we say,<br>
But when refugees knock at doors<br>
We send them back to persecution<br>
After all, your place is your place and ours is ours<br>
Throw out the illegal immigrants, they say<br>
Mughals are villainous, they say<br>
Atithi devo bhava they say,<br>
Namaste they say,<br>
Acknowledge the Brahman in all, they say<br>
The greatest civilisation on earth<br>
That shuts the door on the face of the destitute<br>
None of us belonged here at one time!<br>
Agriculture was unknown 12000 years ago<br>
Our civilization was built by waves and waves of settlers<br>
Be it Aryans or Mughals or Dravidians or Adivasis<br>
What right do we have to say that someone doesn’t belong here<br>
What right do we have to send them back<br>
Women and children to rape and murder<br>
The greatest civilisation on earth<br>
With the blood of refugees and lynched Muslims<br>
Splattered on our hands, countrymen!<br>
Lines that were drawn by men long gone<br>
Jinnah and Gandhi, may they rest in peace<br>
Varnas resolved by sages long dead<br>
What a pity these lines make us hate<br>
These divisions make us unrelenting<br>
Our hearts hardened with hatred<br>
To the pain of real men and women<br>
Hindustanis and Pakistanis<br>
Same skin color, ethnic origins, language and food<br>
Alike in every way<br>
Yet how maginificent is the hatred we harbour<br>
For ones across the line!<br>
Our sides were chosen at random<br>
By the randomness of birth<br>
By the randomness of the sperm and egg that led to us<br>
And the caste/religion/place their vessels were born to<br>
A series of randomness that led to us<br>
Yet how resolutely we have chosen sides<br>
My religion is better than yours<br>
My God is better than yours<br>
You bow to me because I’m privileged<br>
Privileged by the accident of birth<br>
Another throw of the dice<br>
We’d be born a Muslim/Dalit/Refugee<br>
And for no fault of ours,<br>
We’d be at the receiving end of our very own atrocities<br>
We don’t choose our sides, we were born to it<br>
Yet how carried away in our identities we are<br>
How willfully we oppress the others<br>
Allah and Ram are one and the same, Gandhi said<br>
Different names for the same God, he said<br>
Yet in a nation that calls him Father<br>
We put in power those who divide<br>
Left as an opposite to Hindu<br>
Muslim as the antithesis of Hindu<br>
Dangling before us like carrots on a stick<br>
Ram Mandir vs Babri Masjid<br>
RAM vs HAJ<br>
Two alternatives, opposites, that can never coexist<br>
Stamping in those lines into our hearts<br>
Hard with designer shoes from eloquent election podiums<br>
Hammering in our differences<br>
Letting our hearts bleed with hatred<br>
Drawing lines, dividing us<br>
Yet fools that we are we pay heed to them<br>
Fools that we are we dance to their tunes in unaware daze<br>
The hatred in our hearts frozen in a trance<br>
Taking fiery shapes to trample the ‘others’<br>
All Indians are my brothers and sisters we swore<br>
But the asterisks and qualifiers we are now revealed<br>
We, and not they are true inheritors of India’s destiny<br>
We, and not they are the bhagyavidhaata of Bharata<br>
No one cares that we come from the same place!<br>
They have been here as long as we have been<br>
A country forged in diversity, unified in jingoism<br>
A million colors subdued by an oppressive saffron<br>
The tiranga traded in for the bhagwa<br>
Tamil and Kashmiri crushed by a colloquial Hindi<br>
A simmering delicacy of beef, dosa and chicken tikka<br>
Tossed aside for a politically correct Khichdi<br>
Today we live in Godse’s India, not Gandhi’s India<br>
Today our people’s representatives bow down to Savarkar<br>
The same Savarkar that swore to serve the crown of Britain<br>
And crush the struggle for Indian sovereignty<br>
Today they are king who orchestrate riots and fake encounters<br>
Religion that makes it acceptable to trample a full womb<br>
Pull out and char an unborn foetus by the cord of life,<br>
Its ashes washed away in a drain, the lost foetus<br>
Blood on our arms and our heads hung in shame<br>
In our India, foetuses too are branded with religion<br>
Religion that makes it acceptable to pelt stones at benign children<br>
How depraved are we as a civilisation<br>
How fallen are we as a culture<br>
Causes so big that we never hesistate to harm children!<br>
Today they are king who hoodwink an imperfect judiciary<br>
Like a puppet master that pulls at strings<br>
Through loop holes and dead/hostile witnesses<br>
Today they are king who disowned our constitution<br>
Dropping adjectives stealthily<br>
The windows of transparency<br>
That we celebrated as a forthcoming of democracy<br>
Too were given an obstinate coat of saffron paint<br>
In a world of PR campaigns and alternative facts<br>
When will truth prevail?<br>
Satyam kadaa vijayate?<br>
Is there more to India than Hindi, Hindu and Hindutva?<br>
When will the day come when Bharat mata be restored to her glory<br>
When she realises as a tolerant, forgiving mother<br>
That protects one and all in her bosom<br>
That treats each child the same<br>
A place for those who seek peace<br>
When do we grow above the pettiness<br>
And truly become one family!<br>
Truly become Vasudhaive Kutumbakam!</p>
