      <description>Ben Horowitz    My rating: 4.23/5    This is a wonderful book! It gives an insider&amp;rsquo;s view of how it feels to run a startup and decide between conflicting options. It makes even more sense if you&amp;rsquo;ve already run a startup to be able to understand the nuances and the significance of these choices and their context. From hiring for greatness than lack of weakness, networking to spot the PR managers that can turn chicken shit to chicken salad, from management debt to managing profanity in company culture, this book explores a number of pain points.</description>

      <description>Michael E Porter    Rating 2/5    This book was written more than 40 years ago and is textbook MBA material. Porters five forces analysis is a useful tool in any case study paradigm. Most of the book reads like common sense to me probably because much of its content has percolated into popular knowledge over the decades since it was written. I also think that its content has not particular suitable to address current tech industries where most of the wealth in the world is created today.</description>

      <title>How Innovation Works and Why It Flourishes in Freedom </title>

      <description>Matt Ridley    My rating 4/5    Matt Ridley&amp;rsquo;s How Innovation Works is best consumed as an audio book. The book traces the history of innovation in several industries including energy, public health, transport, food, communication and computers. The later half focuses on deriving rules about innovation given the history.
Among the stories of innovation, a case that stuck with me was the state of nuclear energy, which is a promising renewable source that is carbon free, but since iterating to improve the technology is rendered costly due to safety and environmental laws and guarantees, we are stuck with technology that is decades old.</description>

      <title>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</title>

      <description>Cal Newport    My rating: 5/5    Deep Work is a book about focusing. Given the barrage of distractions in today&amp;rsquo;s world, ranging from push notifications, social media and the expectation of responding fast to emails and work group chats, it becomes harder to do the type of work that requires deep focus.
The first few chapters talk about what deep work is and part 2 is about a few tips to get there.</description>

      <description>Amir Levine, Rachel S F Heller    My rating: 4/5    Attached is a book on relationships, especially romantic relationships. It explains the evolutionary advantages to having a partner and how childhood experiences trigger different attachment styles.
Broadly, the book proposes that there are three types of attachment styles: anxious, avoidant and secure. The former two roughly account for a quarter of the population each and the latter accounts for about half.</description>

      <title>The Art of Loving</title>
      <link>https://keerthanapg.com/bookreviews/artofloving/</link>

      <guid>https://keerthanapg.com/bookreviews/artofloving/</guid>
      <description>Eric Fromm    Rating 1/5    This is a highly recommended book on relationships. The core tenet is that western individualism dictates that if you focus on being the best version of yourself, love will follow. However, this book argues that that is far from enough and one needs to be good at loving to find and keep love.
While that advice is useful, I felt that the book was fraught with homophobia and transphobia having been written in the 1950s.</description>

      <description>Colin Bryar, Bill Carr    My rating: 4/5    Working Backwards is a business book on the story and culture of Amazon. The first part deals with the culture of Amazon ranging from hiring, organization, in house communication and metrics of achievement. Amazon culture places a lot of stress on its 14 leadership principles.
 A quote that stuck with me was : every company has a culture, if you don&amp;rsquo;t actively create it, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about it once it is made.</description>

      <description>Noam Chomsky, Ilan Papp√©    My rating: 5/5    I picked up &amp;ldquo;On Palestine&amp;rdquo; at the height of the Israel Palestine conflict in May 2021. It is an interesting summarization of Zionism and the history of Israel and is very poignant and concisely organised. The first part deals with the past, present, future of the conflict and context from within Israel and its relationship with the United States.</description>

      <description>Benjamin Todd    Rating 3/5    If you&amp;rsquo;ve read Doing Good Better, you can totally skip this book. It expands into the research the 80000 hours organisation has done regarding careers and their impacts, so this book would be useful for young people looking to start a career or older folks looking to pivot/doing a reality check on their impact. Sometimes, the book reads like a curated webpage, which it totally is.</description>

      <description>Bill Gates    My rating 5/5    This book was released around a month ago and is the most up to date compilation of issues and challenges surrounding climate change. What I love about this book is that it is markedly different in tone than what many climate activists advise - no angry rhetorics or morally high sounding stances. Crossing the Atlantic in a boat is not an option for everyone and asking the global population to give up on meat is simply non-practical.</description>

      <guid>https://keerthanapg.com/bookreviews/cryptoassets/</guid>
      <description>Chris Burniske    Rating 3/5    I picked up this book because there are way too many keywords thrown around about cryptocurrencies and blockchain and you never know what you don&amp;rsquo;t know. Far from a comprehensive guide to &amp;ldquo;bitcoin and beyond&amp;rdquo;, this book could be summarized as &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin is great. Yields are great. You gotta invest&amp;rdquo;. While the initial few chapters go into explaining the technology and history of blockchain (Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s white paper on bitcoin, Vitalik Buterin&amp;rsquo;s work, Ethereum blockchain reversion to create Ethereum Classic, proof of stake/work), many of the latter chapters are far too repetitive.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama    Rating 4.36/5    Since I am from India, I found the book interesting only up until the point Obama became president. Until that event, the book describes in erudite passion Obama&amp;rsquo;s youth and his journey to the presidency. His conviction is admirable and his courage/confidence is worth envying. What struck me most was his sense of idealism and how much he stood by it over the years even if others were weary.</description>

      <description>Morten T. Hansen    Rating 3.79/5    This is a fairly useful book. I picked it up as I started my first job to be able to get better on managing work. Most insights from the book are derived from a fairly generalised and large survey of workers in the United States. These derivations are also quite practical to be put to use in daily life and helps you anticipate outcomes of organisational decisions and decide how to participate.</description>

      <description>David Graeber    My rating: 4.02/5    David Graeber wrote this book after his very famous essay by the same name. It draws on several anecdotes and responses he received after writing the essay. However, a peculiar thing to note is that despite being an anthropologist from Oxford, this is not based on original research but one could note that some research is cited to support the assertions made in the book.</description>

      <description>Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling R√∂nnlund    My rating: 4.36/5    This book, written by Swedish physician Hans Rosling and published posthumously is an optimistic and fact based take on human development with a focus on health and medicine. Primarily written for a western audience this book assumes the prevalence of a premise of western superiority and then seeks to demolish it. As someone from a developing country, having grown up seeing India change and grow around me, having been witness to notably compounding and progressive improvement across generations in my own family, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as surprised as the author expected the reader to be; as such I felt it intended to speak to a white person in a developed country.</description>

      <description>O.V. Vijayan    Rating 4.11/5    I picked up this critically acclaimed classic to better understand Malayalam literature and life in rural Kerala. It is not one big epic but a collection of incidents set in and around a village that is 10 minutes from my home in Palakkad. The writer exercises abundant subtlely in his narration and bounces forth from reality and imagination so much so that much is left to the interpretation of the reader.</description>

      <description>Kevin Simler, Robin Hanson    My rating: 4.02/5    The first few chapters are very insightful and exciting, especially the part about subtle interactions and deceptions we consciously and subconsciously have cultivated as a society. However, towards the end it gets fairly repetitive and embarks on the same points for far too long. All in all, great read about human psychology.</description>

      <description>Loretta Graziano Breuning    My rating: 3.57/5    The Science of Positivity talks about five hormones and neurotransmitters: serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine, endorphin and cortisol and how they affect our everyday behaviour and rationality. The book draws parallels between human brain and an early mammal brain when it comes to decision making. As for me, it helped me be more conscious of negative thought patterns and make an active effort to be more positive.</description>

      <description>Rajesh Chakrabarti, Kaushiki Sanyal    My rating: 3.97/5    This is a brief introduction to public policy in India. It discusses formulation, analysis and implementation/revision of policy interventions in the Indian context and uses case studies to investigate into examples of good and bad policy implemented in India. A key learning has been about mathematical models used to collect evidence for policy intervention, such as RCTs and difference-in-difference.</description>

      <description>Stehpen Hawking    My rating: 4.17/5    Collection of essays about black holes, quantum mechanics and unified theory that is mostly easy to follow. Hawkings also extrapolates on concepts such as imaginary time, that were controversial parts of &amp;lsquo;A Brief History of Time&amp;rsquo;. The beginning few essays, of his childhood and his fight with ALS, are quite forthcoming and transparent in narrative. The snarky humor at times is an entertaining surprise.</description>

      <description>Sheryl Sandberg, Adam M. Grant    My rating: 3.85/5    Option B is a book that advises on countering adverse situations routed in Sheryl Sandberg&amp;rsquo;s autobiographical account. What makes an adverse experience worse is 3Ps: personalisation(that you&amp;rsquo;re to blame), permanence(that it&amp;rsquo;ll last forever) and pervasiveness(that it affects other areas of life) and one should strive to overcome these thought patterns to build resilience. It also talks about how to deal with people who&amp;rsquo;ve recently encountered an adversity.</description>

      <description>Roger Fisher, William Ury, Bruce Patton    My rating: 3.94/5    This is a book on negotiation that talks about power, ethics, tactics and counter moves in negotiation. It is more about getting what you deserve than gaining more than your fair share. It makes sense to separate the people from the problem, focus on interests over positions, evaluate your alternatives and make the pie bigger for everyone.</description>

      <description>Irvin D. Yalom    My rating: 4.24/5    This book is an account of Yalom&amp;rsquo;s selected cases as a psychoanalyst. It&amp;rsquo;ll impart confidence to your own analysis of human nature and behaviours, and offer to enrich them with the practices and wisdom of an academic insider. What I found most surprising was dream interpretation. While I&amp;rsquo;ve always found dreams as abstract representations of everyday randomness, it was astonishing to realise that dreams are a clinically established means to investigate what troubles the mind.</description>

The author shares a number of wonderful insights to explain why certain events panned out that led to certain characteristics.</description>

      <description>William MacAskill    My rating: 4.25/5    This book is about evaluating altruistic actions quantitatively and presents a number of interesting cases where widely-popular well-meaning efforts fell short. It also discusses simplistic frameworks to gauge effectiveness of actions and warns against being emotionally connected to causes.
While the book doggedly mentions &amp;lsquo;doing the most good&amp;rsquo; and discourages emotional attachment, I think altruism is non-existent without emotions and cannot be discussed without that context.</description>

      <description>Henry Hazlitt    My rating: 4.17/5    This was an okay read. The author often advocates policies without enough justifications, and which can be proved as ineffective assuming the Keynesian theory. It is replete with comparisons between a good economist and a bad economist, instructing on their generic personal traits(eg attention to detail) than how they&amp;rsquo;d decide/act in specific circumstances.</description>

      <description>Peter Thiel, Blake Masters    My rating: 4.18/5    As the name suggests, 0-1 is the go-to notes for an aspiring tech start up founder. It is painfully honest and artfully brief with a lot of graphs and examples. Do read it if you hope to found a company, will hardly take a day.</description>

      <description>Richard Dawkins    Rating 4.15/5    This is one book every person should read! Dawkins makes one question accepted norms and seeds thought-lings of bizzare possibilities . Have you ever wondered why a human fetus has more rights than an adult chimpanzee that can speak one or more human languages? Why do we think cannibalism is gross? We often consider ourselves as a nation, or a species, why not as a genus or as mammals or simply as animals and work for the collective good of say, the mammalian community!</description>

      <description>Darrell Huff, Irving Geis (Illustrator)    My rating: 3.84/5    This is an amusing and extremely short read. Statistics is as much an art as it is a science, he claims. This book gave me an insight into the power of numbers in deception and persuasion. It alerted me to give a second thought into claims backed by stats, the major pitfalls to look for and the fact that even reputed organisations can make conscious and unconscious mistakes.</description>

      <description>Malcolm Gladwell    My rating: 3.99/5    This is a lesson on social-psychology: how different factors come together to cause an epidemic, be it Baltimore&amp;rsquo;s Syphilis, Coke&amp;rsquo;s successful marketing campaign or the American Revolution. Personally, it introduced to me, for the first time, the 80-20 rule(and valuing employees), the connector-maven-salesman factor and the fact that &amp;lsquo;coke&amp;rsquo; is the second most popular word in the world after&amp;rsquo;okay&#39;. Definitely a good read.</description>

      <description>Keith Ferrazzi    My rating: 3.84/5    This is a must read that emphasises on connecting with people. The author has discussed several strategies that help one to reach out farther in everyday life. While it helps to know important people, this book treats people as means rather than ends in themselves. By the author&amp;rsquo;s logic, one can put a numeric value to relationships with different people based on their influence and stature, and that is a very unromantic and utilitarian world that treats relationships as transactional and one-dimensional to an extent.</description>

      <description>Dan Ariely    My rating: 4.12/5    Most of us credit ourselves for being rational individuals and strive for logical consistency in things we do. If you are one, it might be a good idea to read this book and learn the edges of our reasoning. This book will make you question your honesty, your gullibility and your independence of thought. It&amp;rsquo;ll astound you how often we base decisions on seemingly insignificant factors, such as the appearance of a candidate.</description>

      <description>Malcolm Gladwell, Barry Fox, Irina Henegar (Translator)    My rating: 3.95/5    Wonderful read this is! Fast paced,intriguing and spell binding at times! I loved the progressively advancing narrative substantiated by a variety of case studies and the clear-headed line of reasoning. This book is a brilliant aggregate of human behavior, how rapid cognition influences snap decisions and how good decisions with a high statistical precision can be arrived through thin-slicing cases.</description>

      <description>Marjane Satrapi    Rating 4.37/5    Totally worth the three hours!
This is an insider&amp;rsquo;s perspective of Iran&amp;rsquo;s cultural revolution, when their civilisation took a reverse journey amidst war and political instability. Chilling at times, and touching at others. What endeared this book to me is the female narrative, the innocence of her childhood and the courage to confess failures. Here&amp;rsquo;s the story of a little girl who aspired to grow up to be a prophet and forced to confirm into a society of captivated females.</description>

      <description>Robert T. Kiyosaki, Sharon L. Lechter    My rating: 4.11/5    The book starts very promising seeking to counter conventional wisdom of money and investing, and presents quite a few motivational and creative ideas. However, the tone soon turns condescending where the author markets his style of investment, and lashes out at everyone and everything who does otherwise. As Keely here noted, it merely suggests what to do and intimidates the reader about the pitfalls of not doing, but the leaves the reader the figure out the logistics of &amp;lsquo;how to do to&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Stephen Hawking    My rating: 4.20/5    Frankly, the book began quite promisingly and renders the reader hopes of understanding the origin of the universe. As the book proceeded, it became difficult to comprehend and finally ended with concepts like imaginary time and virtual histories all of which no makes no sense to the unassuming reader. However,it is commendable that Hawkings could put to words all of this without letting the reader taste the complicated math.</description>

      <description>Bill Bryson    My rating: 4.20/5    This is a phenomenal book that traces the scientific history of the universe and the world, as we know it. It synthesizes for a layman a number of theories and facts about the birth of the universe, particle physics, formation of earth, plate tectonics and volcanic activity, the beginning, evolution and continuous extinction of life, among other things. It also traces the scientific revolution of the last 400 years and one cannot feel but astounded at how weakly mounted on evidence are theories we regard as widely held knowledge.</description>

      <description>Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner    My rating: 4/5    A peculiar book. Intended to puzzle but not without exaggerations. Correlation and causality are often interchangeably used.</description>

      <description>J.D. Salinger    My rating: 3.81/5    This is a very short book, quite a ramble though. The language is very vernacular, often plain and non-creative. It is slightly irritating at first, all the unnecessary emphasis, but one gets used to it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t see why this book is a symbol of teenage rebellion, or why people like the protagonist at all. He generalizes a lot, blames a multitude of external factors for his circumstances and hates and stereotypes almost every other character.</description>
