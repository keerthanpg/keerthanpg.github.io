<p>This is one book every person should read! Dawkins makes one question accepted norms and seeds thought-lings of bizzare possibilities . Have you ever wondered why a human fetus has more rights than an adult chimpanzee that can speak one or more human languages? Why do we think cannibalism is gross? We often consider ourselves as a nation, or a species, why not as a genus or as mammals or simply as animals and work for the collective good of say, the mammalian community!</p>
<p>The lucidity with which he breaks down complex concepts amazes me. It was thought provoking to read about various types strategies in play around us(Dove-Hawk, Grudger-Sucker-Cheat, Coy-Fast), their simplified versions and mutual equilibria and how these strategies direct our decision making to make the world behave how it does now.</p>
<p>But nothing beats the peculiarity of genetic relations in an ant colony. Did you know that male ant workers do not have a father? Did you know that ants have their own cattle to milk tree-sap from? Did you know ants has spiraling fungi farms and they constantly weeded it?</p>
<p>Read and find out!</p>
