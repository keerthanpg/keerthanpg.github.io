<p>Attached is a book on relationships, especially romantic relationships. It explains the evolutionary advantages to having a partner and how childhood experiences trigger different attachment styles.</p>
<p>Broadly, the book proposes that there are three types of attachment styles: anxious, avoidant and secure. The former two roughly account for a quarter of the population each and the latter accounts for about half.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxious attachment is characterized by a need for reassurance, obsession over the relationship and feeling unworthy of love.</li>
<li>Avoidant attachment style is characterized by a fear of commitment and intimacy, avoidance of conflict and holding a partner at arms length.</li>
<li>Secure attachment style entails the ability to communicate well and especially through conflict, the ability to commit and love securely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the attachment styles, the worst combination is avoidant/anxious. If you&rsquo;re an avoidant or anxious individual you&rsquo;d be better off partnering with an individual with a secure attachment style. It is also possible to change your attachment style by recognizing one&rsquo;s insecurities and addressing them.</p>
<p>I loved that the book was backed by research on psychology.</p>
