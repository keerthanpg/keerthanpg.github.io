      <description>Hi
I am Keerthana! I am a roboticist at Google Brain, so by day I convert coffee into code for training robots to do everyday tasks. I can talk endlessly about artificial intelligence and self-driving. I am also passionate about investing and stock markets, start-ups and technology, fitness, public policy in India and gender equality.
A part of my day is spent playing with my pug puppy Kiwi, who is monstrosity and innocence rolled into one.</description>
